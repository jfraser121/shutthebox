things to do:

    simulate dice rolls
        function - pick number of dice 
    make the game function thing
        playable by human
            pick what number to go up to
    then interface with robot ai players to test strategies

    make_move(board_state, move) 



eventually - plot the avg scores of different strategies against some stuff
