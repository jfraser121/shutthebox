things to do:

    figure out how to prune the tree thing to minimise expected scores
    think about base case
    tiles remaining: 2, 3, 5
    roll: 5
            L < pick > R
            5       2, 3
remaining: 2,3     5
    L can make: 2,3,5
    R can make: 5


NEW PLAN:
want to figure out best choice at each point 
do this by calculating expected value at each point in the game
do this in simtools i think


stages:
BOARDSTATE - which tiles are still up?
LEGAL ROLLS - which rolls would allow you to take a turn?   is this necessary???
